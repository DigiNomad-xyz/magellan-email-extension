# Email Extension

[According to a Canadian survey, people spend a total of 17 hours a week](https://newsroom.carleton.ca/archives/2017/04/20/carleton-study-finds-people-spending-third-job-time-email/) reading, responding and sending work emails both at work and at home. 

## Usage
```
# While in Gmail press

## MacOS
CMD + k

## Windows
CNTRL + k
```

The search function in Gmail is robust, but it can be cumbersome to recall the operators and properly format dates. Using this extension a separate query box be available built ontop of existing gmail search functionality. GenAI will create the operators necessary for refineded searches.
